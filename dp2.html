                <p>People who experience diagnosed or undiagnosed dietary restrictions 
                    or allergies need a place to track their meals and the corresponding 
                    symptoms to further understand any relationships so that they can create 
                    the best diet for themselves.</p>

                <h3>Description:</h3>
                        <p>This project was for a course I took in the Fall 2021 semester, ENTR 390 (Digital Product Design). This was 
                            the second major project of the class. I came up with the idea for Chow after seeing a family member
                            struggle with newfound dietary restrictions and allergies. The idea felt
                            like the best and most simple solution, and proved to be so through User Testing. 
                            I sketched out my ideas and developed them into wireframes using Figma. I 
                            designed the high-fidelity prototype in Figma which is linked to the image above.</p>
                        <p>
                            Chow provides a space for users to track meals and symptoms related to those meals. 
                            Throughout the development process, the product changed direction and narrowed down in scope. 
                            The product interprets relationships between certain foods and the symptoms tracked for that day or 
                            the related meal time. The value behind Chow is that it learns about the user within the first few uses 
                            until the algorithm understands the user’s eating habits and symptom frequencies. Using this information, 
                            Chow creates charts displayed on the homescreen so the user can get a summarized and interpretable view of their 
                            symptoms for the current week.  As the user interacts with Chow more, the data will become increasingly accurate.

                <h3>Persona Profiles:</h3>
                <p>The primary persona for Chow is someone recently diagnosed with food allergies or dietary restrictions who is unsure of how to 
                    keep their symptoms under control and wants to create a diet that makes them feel better. The primary persona I created for Chow was Anna. 
                    Anna is 23 years old and recently graduated from college. After several years of feeling unwell after many meals she visited a doctor who 
                    diagnosed her as sensitive to gluten, dairy, and recommended trying a Low FODMAP or SIBO diet. He recommends that Anna avoids gluten and dairy 
                    entirely but they are ingrained in her diet. She is still learning what meals do not contain gluten and dairy and wants to try either SIBO or 
                    Low FODMAP. She wants a tool to help her adjust to her new sensitivities. Chow benefits Anna because she can try either diet for a few weeks at 
                    a time and track her symptoms to see which reduces her symptoms most. She can track it all in one place and make her transition towards a new 
                    diet easier with the data about how certain foods affect her.
                    <br><br>
                    The secondary persona for Chow is someone who is undiagnosed, believes their diet is causing their recurring symptom(s), and wants to determine 
                    what is the root cause. The secondary persona I created for Chow is Liam. Liam is 17 years old, a junior in high school, and frequently experiences 
                    nausea, bloating, and indigestion. Liam eats nearly all foods. He learned that experiencing nausea, bloating, and indigestion to his frequency is abnormal. 
                    He decides to learn on his own what is causing these issues. Liam finds Chow which allows him to track all of the foods he eats in a day and track his 
                    symptoms alongside the varying foods. While doing this, he starts reading the charts that Chow is creating for him and begins trying an elimination diet. 
                    He eliminates the foods he sees frequently appear on days of particular trouble. He notices improvements after three weeks of cutting out all nuts. Next 
                    he is going to try cutting out soy.

                <h3>Sketches:</h3>
                <p>I began by sketching out ideas for the interface. My main focus was creating a platform
                    that was simple and to the point with all the necessary functions. Since the user is likely 
                    using this to collect information about what foods cause them the most difficulty, I made sure to put the 
                    most useful functions on the homepage along with a chart of the week's data. These sketches show 
                    the early ideas I then adapted into wireframes.

                    product and began creating wireframing in Figma.
